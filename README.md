Some of my past year paper solution is located under the file PYP_Solution. Notice that the solution is not error free, if you have any confusion or find any fault in it, don't hestiate to contact the Wechat: LABCD2000

Upload the mindmap in the file of Mindmap, the mindmap is a little bit too detailed and redundant, maybe later if I have spare time I should refine them. But anyway, I think the process of drawing mindmap is truely the process of structuring the knowledge, everyone should be encouraged to draw their own mindmap.

## If you have any past year papers before 2021, I would appreciate it very much if you share me with the Wechat ID: LABCD2000

All the best to the final!!!
